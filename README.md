# AI-TSP-Analysis

This is a project in my Artificial Intelligence class. It is about analyzing different algorithms for 
Travelling Salesman Problem, which is a famous NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. 

Even though it has not been solved but various algorithms have been created to solve either the math model or 
the real-world problems. None of them is perfect, but when there is a specific problem, like how to generate 
a solution for traveling each city in different countries, it is possible to look for solutions to some degree. 
If we use a real country with hundreds of cities, we are supposed to consider the memory and runtime issue
when searching for solutions. Even for small TSP with 10 cities, it could take a long time to get the results 
on computers. To start with, getting familiar with all the algorithms is necessary. The literature review below 
will be an overview of the field, with a focus on analyzing relatively the most helpful algorithms and
how they can contribute to the project.
